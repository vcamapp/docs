## Initial setup

1. Open this app
2. Grant cam, mic or network permission requests when prompted. These permissions are required for the avatar control and the virtual camera.
3. Install plug-ins when prompted. 
4. Open an app that uses the virtual camera, such as Zoom or OBS, and check if the avatar is displayed.

If not, see [FAQ.md (ja)](/FAQ.md) for troubleshooting.

### Reinstall the plugin
If the plug-in installation fails or the virtual camera does not work, click "Set up" in the menu and reinstall the plug-in.
