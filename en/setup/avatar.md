# Loading Avatars

You can load a model from the "File" option in the menu. Currently, it supports [VRM files](https://vrm.dev/) located locally or models from [VRoid Hub](https://hub.vroid.com/).

You can also drag & drop the model file to load it.

When you load a local VRM file, the app will automatically load that model the next time you restart. Models from VRoid Hub won't be set automatically, so please reconfigure them.

Please refer to the following documentation for the method:
