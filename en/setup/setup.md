# Initial Settings

1. Open the app.
2. If asked for permission to use the microphone or network, grant it. These features are essential for operating the avatar and for the virtual camera to function.
3. If an alert prompts you to install a plugin, proceed with the installation.
4. Open applications like Zoom or OBS that utilize the virtual camera, and check if the avatar is displayed.

If it's not displayed, refer to the [Frequently Asked Questions](../other/faq.md) for troubleshooting.

## Reinstalling the Plugin

If the plugin installation fails or if the virtual camera doesn't work correctly, click on "Initial Settings" in the menu to reposition the plugin.
