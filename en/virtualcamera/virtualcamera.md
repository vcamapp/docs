# Virtual Camera Settings

VCam has a camera function called a virtual camera.

By using this, you can get video conferencing apps such as Zoom and Google Meet to recognize VCam as a camera.

## Set up the Virtual Camera

In the "Virtual Camera" settings of VCam, you can check the status and install or uninstall the virtual camera.

Currently, there are two types of virtual cameras:

* Virtual Camera (DAL)
  * Installed upon the first launch.
* New Virtual Camera (CameraExtension)
  * Currently, only supporters can use this feature.

The new virtual camera reduces the load on the Mac.

Also, Apple has announced that "Virtual Camera (DAL)" will no longer be supported in macOS 14.
