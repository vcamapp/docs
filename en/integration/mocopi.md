## Tips / Usage Techniques

The mocopi app works even in the background. Therefore, you can connect to [VCamMocap](https://tattn.fanbox.cc/posts/5134895) and iFacialMocap simultaneously.

### The mocopi app starts tracking, but it doesn't reflect in VCam

Ensure your iPhone and Mac are connected to the same WiFi. Check if port "12351" is not blocked by security software.

You can check the operation without mocopi using [BVH Sender](https://www.sony.net/Products/mocopi-dev/jp/downloads/DownloadInfo.html#BVH_Sender) (please specify the IP address as 127.0.0.1). If the motion from this app reflects in VCam, there might be an issue with the network settings. Please check again.

### Want to disconnect from mocopi

Uncheck "Enable mocopi" from the Integration tab in the settings. Then select the tracking method in the Tracking tab. If you can't select "Hand," ensure the mocopi integration checkbox is unchecked.

### Cannot move forward or backward in mocopi

Currently, only left and right movements are reflected. Please wait for a future update for forward and backward movements.
