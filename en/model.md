Model Selection
---

You can load a model from the menu "File".  
Currently, models from local [VRM files](https://vrm.dev/en/) or [VRoid Hub](https://hub.vroid.com/) are supported.

VRM models can also be created in [VRoid Studio](https://vroid.com/en/studio).

You can also drag and drop model files to load them.

If you load a local VRM file, it will automatically load the model when you restart the app; VRoid Hub models are not automatically configured, so you will need to reconfigure them.
