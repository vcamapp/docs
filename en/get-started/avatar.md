# Loading Avatar

From the menu, select "File" to load a model. Currently, it supports [VRM files](https://vrm.dev/) available locally or models from [VRoid Hub](https://hub.vroid.com/).

You can also drag & drop the model file to load it.

If you load a local VRM file, the app will automatically load that model when you restart it. VRoid Hub models are not set automatically, so please reconfigure them.

## Want to Load FBX or MMD Files?

By using Unity, you can convert many files into the VRM format, which can be read in VCam.

Please check the following documentation for the method:
