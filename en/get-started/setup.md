# Initial Setup

1. Open the app.
2. If prompted for microphone or network permissions, grant them. These functions are essential for avatar control and the operation of the virtual camera.
3. If alerted to install a plugin, proceed with the installation.
4. Open apps that use virtual cameras, like Zoom or OBS, and check if the avatar is displayed.

If it doesn't display, please refer to the [FAQ](../other/faq.md) for troubleshooting.

## Reinstalling the Plugin

If the plugin installation fails or the virtual camera does not function correctly, click on "Initial Setup" in the menu and reposition the plugin.
